### **Surf Myths and Car Park Chatter**
I only picked up surfing as a hobby recently, so I don't have the experience to know if what the more experienced surfer is true or just a myth. For this project, I gathered wind, weather and wave data to test various surfing concepts that you might hear in the car park or at the beach. I found answers to the questions of whether the surf is better in winter or in summer and if good weather = good surf or bad weather = bad surf. This project involved web crawling and scraping for data followed by extensive data exploration, feature engineering and visualization.
